HoaComposerWatcher
==================

for use its its simple by default we check the parent repository of the current execution ex:

>$ php watcher
>$ /var/www/HoaComposerWatcher php watcher.php 
  
In this command we check /var/www/*/composer.json, if you want to bypass this you must edit the ligne 16 or do a PR ;)
